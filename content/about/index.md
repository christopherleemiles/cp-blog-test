_The Control Plane is a blog&nbsp;focused on varying network technologies and topics. &nbsp;The blog is written and managed by Chris Miles, a network engineer for a MPLS and Cisco HCS provider. &nbsp;This blog will serve as a primary way to document new technologies in his&nbsp;pursuit to gain a CCIE certification. &nbsp;Once that is completed, this blog will hopefully transition to a new topic base focusing on experiments with new topics, such as Network Automation. &nbsp; &nbsp;_
