I recently burned myself by creating a bridging loop on a production network, so I figured this would be a good topic to review.  Lesson learned: Do NOT assume vSwitches run STP.   But anyway&#8230;  Layer 2 is a dangerous place.  A loop in your L2 domain doesn&#8217;t have built-in TTL values like you do at Layer 3.  Therefore, a bridging loop can absolutely kill your network if you&#8217;re not careful.  Hence the reason we have Spanning-Tree Protocol as a loop prevention method.  STP may be strict, but it&#8217;s a necessary measure to make absolutely sure you&#8217;re not causing an infinite bridging loop.

&nbsp;

There are 3 versions of spanning tree that are commonly deployed today:

  * Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)
  * Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (Rapid PVST)
  * Multiple Spanning Tree (MST)

First we&#8217;ll discuss the basic operations of STP which are mostly the same among all versions, and then get into PVST.  I will cover RSTP and MST in separate blog posts.

&nbsp;

## STP &#8211; Basic Operation

STP is originally defined in IEEE 802.1D.  The purpose of STP is simple&#8230; loop prevention.  It does so through a simple, yet effective process of building a tree topology in order to determine where duplicate links exist and block potential loops.  To build this &#8220;tree&#8221; it must start by electing a Root Switch.  This switch will be where the tree is built from.  The tree is then built outbound from the root, towards the &#8220;leaves&#8221; and block unnecessary links.

#### Electing a Root Switch

In order for a Layer 2 topology to proper elect the root switch, all the switches must gather information about all the switches in the topology.  To do so, when the switches power on, they begin sending out Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) out all its available ports.  The BPDU is essentially a frame that carries particular information about that switch with respect to STP.  BPDU frame format can be seen below:

Configuration BPDU&#8217;s are used for the sake of converging STP, while Topology Change Notifications are used to notify other switches of a link being lost/flapping/etc.

The worthy fields to mention about the configuration BPDU are:

**Root Bridge ID**: Bridge ID that the originating switch believes is the Root

**Root Path Cost**: Originating switch&#8217;s cost to reach the current Root Bridge

**Sending BID: **Bridge ID of the switch sending the BPDU

**Sending PID: **Port number of the switch that the BPDU is being sent from

&nbsp;

**Bridge ID**:

Once all BPDU&#8217;s have been forwarded throughout the Layer 2 domain, all switches must agree on which switch is the Root.  They do this by evaluating the Bridge ID of each switch, and choosing the one with the LOWEST BID.  The BID is composed of a couple different items: Priority & MAC address. _Note: This was expanded upon in PVST to include a System ID __extension, we&#8217;ll touch on that later_.

Priority is 2 byte field that ranges from 0-65535 (or 61440 when System ID ext was added.  The default is set to 32768.  The bridge with the lowest priority will be declared as the RB.  In the event of a tie (which will happen if all values are set to the default), the switch with the lowest MAC address in their BID will be declared root. Below you can see that when the BID format was altered, the priority value was changed instead to multiples of 4096 as the field was reduced to 4 bits.

#### Port Roles

After the Root switch has been elected, each switch need to determine the role of each of it&#8217;s ports.  First, they will choose a Root Port.  This will be the port with the lowest cost to reach the root.  How the switch determines the cost value associated with the types of ports is shown below.  The far right column expresses the cost in the new long method of cost metrics.  Most Catalyst models will default to the 802.1D-1998 standard for PVST and RSTP, while 802.1D-2004 for MST.

_Note:  Until the 802.1D-1998 standard, there was not a proper cost value associated with higher bandwidth links.  As you can see, the switch would assign the same cost value to any port 1Gig or higher.  _

Once the lowest cost to the root is determined, that port is labeled as the Root Port and is placed in a Forwarding state.

&nbsp;

Designated Port:

Once the switch has determined the Root port, it will need to see if it has any Designated ports. A designated port is a port facing downstream, away from the root, that is in the forwarding state.  In order for a switch to determine that the port can be classified as Designated, it has to be the bridge sending the &#8220;best&#8221; BPDU on that particular segment.  In other words, it needs to have a better path to the root than the other bridge on that segment.  Furthermore, switches will only send Configuration BPDU&#8217;s on on Designated ports.  Sending a configuration BPDU on a Root port would obviously be inferior and, therefore, ignored.

From the Root Port&#8217;s perspective, it will always be sending the best BPDU on every segment, so ALL ports are placed in the designated state.

From a Non-Root perspective, it is possible that only your root port will be in the forwarding state, depending on where the switch sits in the network.  If all other ports are not sending a superior BPDU, then they will be placed into the blocking state, and no MAC addresses can be learned on those ports.  This is one of the disadvantages of spanning tree&#8230; It is possible that many links in your topology will not be utilized, simply because there would be a potential loop.  In the event that there is a tie between two switches on who has the superior BPDU (i.e. they both have the same exact cost to the root) the switch with the lower SBID will be granted the role of Designated on the segment.

&nbsp;

Blocking:

Any ports not declared as Designated or Root will be placed in the blocking state.
